punchline: The Re-Boogaloo-ing - ♪ A whole new chat, a new fantastic chat window ♪
description: |-
  Chat 3 is a complete rewrite of the in-game chat window as a plugin. It
  supports:

  - Unlimited tabs
  - Tabs that always send to a certain channel
  - More flexible filtering
  - RGB channel colouring
  - Completely variable font size
  - Sidebar tabs
  - Unread counts
  - Screenshot mode (obfuscate names)

  Chat 3 is forked from Chat 2, which was originally written by Anna.

  If you are already using Chat 2, please disable it before enabling Chat 3.
  Chat 3 will refuse to load if Chat 2 is enabled. If you have an existing Chat
  2 configuration, it will be copied over on first load.

  Differences from Chat 2:
  - Clickable URLs
  - Add a button to only copy the message content, not including the sender
  - Ability to select ExtraChat channels as input channels for tabs
  - Replaced copy popover with clipboard copy
  - Button to fully delete database (to save disk space and speed up load times)
  - Various fixes
  - Upgraded to .NET 8.0
